Doubtfull it stood,As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald(Worthie to be a Rebell, for to thatThe multiplying Villanies of NatureDoe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne IslesOf Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,Which smoak'd with bloody execution(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,Till hee fac'd the Slaue:Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements   King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman   Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,Began a fresh assault   King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth andBanquoh?  Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;Or the Hare, the Lyon:If I say sooth, I must report they wereAs Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,Or memorize another Golgotha,I cannot tell: but I am faint,My Gashes cry for helpe   King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.Enter Rosse and Angus.Who comes here?  Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse   Lenox.

From Fiffe, great King,Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,And fanne our people cold.Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,The Victorie fell on vs   King. Great happinesse   Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,Craues composition:Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse   King.

Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liuesA prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whenceYou owe this strange Intelligence, or whyVpon this blasted Heath you stop our wayWith such Prophetique greeting?Speake, I charge you.Witches vanish.  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?  Macb.

The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,The newes of thy successe: and when he readesThy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst makeStrange Images of death, as thick as TaleCan post with post, and euery one did beareThy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,And powr'd them downe before him   Ang. Wee are sent,To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,Onely to harrold thee into his sight,Not pay thee   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,For it is thine   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,Which he deserues to loose.Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,And vantage; or that with both he labour'dIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,Haue ouerthrowne him   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,Promis'd no lesse to them   Banq. That trusted home,Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray'sIn deepest consequence.Cousins, a word, I pray you   Macb. Two Truths are told,As happy Prologues to the swelling ActOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:This supernaturall sollicitingCannot be ill; cannot be good.If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,Against the vse of Nature? Present FearesAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,Shakes so my single state of Man,That Function is smother'd in surmise,And nothing is, but what is not   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,Why Chance may Crowne me,Without my stirre   Banq. New Honors come vpon himLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,But with the aid of vse   Macb. Come what come may,Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure   Macb. Giue me your fauour:My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,Where euery day I turne the Leafe,To reade them.Let vs toward the King: thinke vponWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speakeOur free Hearts each to other   Banq.

O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,That I did kill them   Macd. Wherefore did you so?  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:Th' expedition of my violent LoueOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their DaggersVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,Courage, to make's loue knowne?  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa   Macd. Looke to the Lady   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,That most may clayme this argument for ours?  Donal.

Why see you not?  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine   Ross. Alas the day,What good could they pretend?  Macd. They were subborned,Malcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two SonnesAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon themSuspition of the deed   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vpThine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth   Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to SconeTo be inuested   Rosse. Where is Duncans body?  Macd. Carried to Colmekill,The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,And Guardian of their Bones   Rosse. Will you to Scone?  Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife   Rosse. Well, I will thither   Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: AdieuLeast our old Robes sit easier then our new   Rosse.

'Tis much he dares,And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,To act in safetie. There is none but he,Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is saidMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,When first they put the Name of King vpon me,And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,Put Rancours in the Vessell of my PeaceOnely for them, and mine eternall IewellGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,And champion me to th' vtterance.Who's there?Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.Exit Seruant.Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

True, my Lord   Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,That euery minute of his being, thrustsAgainst my neer'st of Life: and though I couldWith bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,That I to your assistance doe make loue,Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,For sundry weightie Reasons   2.Murth.

What? is this so?  1 I Sir, all this is so. But whyStands Macbeth thus amazedly?Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,And shew the best of our delights.Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,While you performe your Antique round:That this great King may kindly say,Our duties, did his welcome pay.Musicke.

You must haue patience Madam   Wife. He had none:His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,Our feares do make vs Traitors   Rosse. You know notWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,His Mansion, and his Titles, in a placeFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;As little is the Wisedome, where the flightSo runnes against all reason   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowesThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,But cruell are the times, when we are TraitorsAnd do not know our selues: when we hold RumorFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,But floate vpon a wilde and violent SeaEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,Blessing vpon you   Wife. Father'd he is,And yet hee's Father-lesse   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longerIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.I take my leaue at once.Exit Rosse.  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,And what will you do now? How will you liue?  Son. As Birds do Mother   Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?  Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they   Wife. Poore Bird,Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,The Pitfall, nor the Gin   Son. Why should I Mother?Poore Birds they are not set for:My Father is not dead for all your saying   Wife. Yes, he is dead:How wilt thou do for a Father?  Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?  Wife. I, that he was   Son. What is a Traitor?  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,And must be hang'd   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?  Wife. Euery one   Son. Who must hang them?  Wife. Why, the honest men   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for thereare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,and hang vp them   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:But how wilt thou do for a Father?  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if youwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickelyhaue a new Father   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?Enter a Messenger.  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.If you will take a homely mans aduice,Be not found heere: Hence with your little onesTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,I dare abide no longer.Exit Messenger  Wife. Whether should I flye?I haue done no harme. But I remember nowI am in this earthly world: where to do harmeIs often laudable, to do good sometimeAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)Do I put vp that womanly defence,To say I haue done no harme?What are these faces?Enter Murtherers.  Mur. Where is your Husband?  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,Where such as thou may'st finde him   Mur. He's a Traitor   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine   Mur. What you Egge?Yong fry of Treachery?  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,Run away I pray you.Exit crying Murther.Scaena Tertia.Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & thereWeepe our sad bosomes empty   Macd. Let vs ratherHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowesStrike heauen on the face, that it resoundsAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd outLike Syllable of Dolour   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but somethingYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedomeTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent LambeT' appease an angry God   Macd. I am not treacherous   Malc. But Macbeth is.A good and vertuous Nature may recoyleIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.Though all things foule, would wear the brows of graceYet Grace must still looke so   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes   Malc. Perchance euen thereWhere I did finde my doubts.Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,Without leaue-taking. I pray you,Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,What euer I shall thinke   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,And the rich East to boot   Mal. Be not offended:I speake not as in absolute feare of you:I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gashIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,There would be hands vplifted in my right:And heere from gracious England haue I offerOf goodly thousands. But for all this,When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore CountryShall haue more vices then it had before,More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,By him that shall succeede   Macd. What should he be?  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I knowAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,That when they shall be open'd, blacke MacbethWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore StateEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'dWith my confinelesse harmes   Macd. Not in the LegionsOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'dIn euils, to top Macbeth   Mal. I grant him Bloody,Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinneThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, noneIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vpThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my DesireAll continent Impediments would ore-beareThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,Then such an one to reigne   Macd. Boundlesse intemperanceIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beeneTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,And fall of many Kings. But feare not yetTo take vpon you what is yours: you mayConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot beThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so manyAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,Finding it so inclinde   Mal. With this, there growesIn my most ill-composd Affection, suchA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,Desire his Iewels, and this others House,And my more-hauing, would be as a SawceTo make me hunger more, that I should forgeQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,Destroying them for wealth   Macd. This Auaricestickes deeper: growes with more pernicious rooteThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath binThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your willOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,With other Graces weigh'd   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,I haue no rellish of them, but aboundIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I shouldPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,Vprore the vniuersall peace, confoundAll vnity on earth   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:I am as I haue spoken   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?Since that the truest Issue of thy ThroneBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall FatherWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,Thy hope ends heere   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passionChilde of integrity, hath from my souleWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughtsTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,By many of these traines, hath sought to win meInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes meFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboueDeale betweene thee and me; For euen nowI put my selfe to thy Direction, andVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiureThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,For strangers to my Nature. I am yetVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.At no time broke my Faith, would not betrayThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delightNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speakingWas this vpon my selfe. What I am trulyIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:Whither indeed, before they heere approachOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike menAlready at a point, was setting foorth:Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesseBe like our warranted Quarrell.

I thanke you Doctor   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.A most myraculous worke in this good King,Which often since my heere remaine in England,I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauenHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited peopleAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spokenTo the succeeding Royalty he leauesThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,That speake him full of Grace.Enter Rosse.  Macd. See who comes heere   Malc.

Why well   Macd. And all my Children?  Rosse. Well too   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the TydingsWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a RumourOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.Now is the time of helpe: your eye in ScotlandWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,To doffe their dire distresses   Malc. Bee't their comfortWe are comming thither: Gracious England hathLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,An older, and a better Souldier, noneThat Christendome giues out   Rosse. Would I could answerThis comfort with the like. But I haue wordsThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,Where hearing should not latch them   Macd. What concerne they,The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefeDue to some single brest?  Rosse. No minde that's honestBut in it shares some woe, though the maine partPertaines to you alone   Macd. If it be mineKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,Which shall possesse them with the heauiest soundthat euer yet they heard   Macd.

Sinfull Macduff,They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,Not for their owne demerits, but for mineFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefeConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfeWithin my Swords length set him, if he scapeHeauen forgiue him too   Mal. This time goes manly:Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,Our lacke is nothing but our leaue.

Seyton, I am sick at hart,When I behold: Seyton, I say, this pushWill cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.I haue liu'd long enough: my way of lifeIs falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,And that which should accompany Old-Age,As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breathWhich the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.Seyton?Enter Seyton.  Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?  Macb. What Newes more?  Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported   Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.Giue me my Armor   Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet   Macb. Ile put it on:Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:How do's your Patient, Doctor?  Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,As she is troubled with thicke-comming FanciesThat keepe her from her rest   Macb. Cure of that:Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,And with some sweet Obliuious AntidoteCleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffeWhich weighes vpon the heart?  Doct. Therein the PatientMust minister to himselfe   Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, castThe Water of my Land, finde her Disease,And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue druggeWould scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?  Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall PreparationMakes vs heare something   Macb. Bring it after me:I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane   Doct.

We doubt it nothing   Seyw. What wood is this before vs?  Ment. The wood of Birnane   Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadowThe numbers of our Hoast, and make discoueryErre in report of vs   Sold. It shall be done   Syw. We learne no other, but the confident TyrantKeepes still in Dunsinane, and will indureOur setting downe befor't   Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:For where there is aduantage to be giuen,Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,And none serue with him, but constrained things,Whose hearts are absent too   Macd. Let our iust CensuresAttend the true euent, and put we onIndustrious Souldiership   Sey. The time approaches,That will with due decision make vs knowWhat we shall say we haue, and what we owe:Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,But certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,Towards which, aduance the warre.Exeunt. marchingScena Quinta.Enter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.  Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strengthWill laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?A Cry within of Women.  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord   Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'dTo heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haireWould at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirreAs life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughtsCannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;There would haue beene a time for such a word:To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,To the last Syllable of Recorded time:And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted FoolesThe way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,And then is heard no more. It is a TaleTold by an Ideot, full of sound and furySignifying nothing.Enter a Messenger.Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly   Mes. Gracious my Lord,I should report that which I say I saw,But know not how to doo't   Macb. Well, say sir   Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the HillI look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thoughtThe Wood began to moue   Macb. Lyar, and Slaue   Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:Within this three Mile may you see it comming.I say, a mouing Groue   Macb. If thou speak'st false,Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliueTill Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,I care not if thou dost for me as much.I pull in Resolution, and beginTo doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane WoodDo come to Dunsinane, and now a WoodComes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,If this which he auouches, do's appeare,There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.Exeunt.Scena Sexta.Drumme and Colours. Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe, andtheir Army,with Boughes.  Mal.

Worthy Macduffe, and weeShall take vpon's what else remaines to do,According to our order   Sey. Fare you well:Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight   Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breathThose clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.Exeunt.Alarums continued.Scena Septima.Enter Macbeth.  Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,But Beare-like I must fight the course. What's heThat was not borne of Woman? Such a oneAm I to feare, or none.Enter young Seyward.  Y.Sey. What is thy name?  Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it   Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter nameThen any is in hell   Macb. My name's Macbeth   Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a TitleMore hatefull to mine eare   Macb. No: nor more fearefull   Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my SwordIle proue the lye thou speak'st.Fight, and young Seyward slaine.  Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.Enter.Alarums. Enter Macduffe.  Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armesAre hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edgeI sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,By this great clatter, one of greatest noteSeemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,And more I begge not.Exit. Alarums.Enter Malcolme and Seyward.  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,The day almost it selfe professes yours,And little is to do   Malc. We haue met with FoesThat strike beside vs   Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.Exeunt. AlarumEnter Macbeth.  Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dyeOn mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashesDo better vpon them.Enter Macduffe.  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'dWith blood of thine already   Macd. I haue no words,My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier VillaineThen tearmes can giue thee out.Fight: Alarum  Macb. Thou loosest labourAs easie may'st thou the intrenchant AyreWith thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeldTo one of woman borne   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'dTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers wombVntimely ript   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,That palter with vs in a double sence,That keepe the word of promise to our eare,And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters arePainted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,Heere may you see the Tyrant   Macb. I will not yeeldTo kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,Yet I will try the last. Before my body,I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.Exeunt. fighting. Alarums.Enter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.Retreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,Seyward,Rosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.  Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,So great a day as this is cheapely bought   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,He onely liu'd but till he was a man,The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'dIn the vnshrinking station where he fought,But like a man he dy'de   Sey. Then he is dead?  Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrowMust not be measur'd by his worth, for thenIt hath no end   Sey. Had he his hurts before?  Rosse. I, on the Front   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,I would not wish them to a fairer death:And so his Knell is knoll'd   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,and that Ile spend for him   Sey. He's worth no more,They say he parted well, and paid his score,And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.Behold where standsTh' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,That speake my salutation in their minds:Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.Haile King of Scotland   All. Haile King of Scotland.Flourish.  Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and KinsmenHenceforth be Earles, the first that euer ScotlandIn such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,Which would be planted newly with the time,As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,Producing forth the cruell MinistersOf this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,Tooke off her life. This, and what need full elseThat call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,We will performe in measure, time, and place:So thankes to all at once, and to each one,Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.Flourish.
