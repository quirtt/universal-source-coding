When shall we three meet againe?In Thunder, Lightning, or in Raine?  2. When the Hurley-burley's done,When the Battaile's lost, and wonne   3. That will be ere the set of Sunne   1. Where the place?  2. Vpon the Heath   3. There to meet with Macbeth   1. I come, Gray-Malkin   All. Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre.Exeunt.Scena Secunda.Alarum within. Enter King Malcome, Donalbaine, Lenox, withattendants,meeting a bleeding Captaine.  King. What bloody man is that? he can report,As seemeth by his plight, of the ReuoltThe newest state   Mal. This is the Serieant,Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,As thou didst leaue it   Cap. Doubtfull it stood,As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald(Worthie to be a Rebell, for to thatThe multiplying Villanies of NatureDoe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne IslesOf Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,Which smoak'd with bloody execution(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,Till hee fac'd the Slaue:Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements   King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman   Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,Began a fresh assault   King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth andBanquoh?  Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;Or the Hare, the Lyon:If I say sooth, I must report they wereAs Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,Or memorize another Golgotha,I cannot tell: but I am faint,My Gashes cry for helpe   King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.Enter Rosse and Angus.Who comes here?  Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse   Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange   Rosse. God saue the King   King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?  Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,And fanne our people cold.Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,The Victorie fell on vs   King. Great happinesse   Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,Craues composition:Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse   King. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiueOur Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,And with his former Title greet Macbeth   Rosse. Ile see it done   King.

Macb. So foule and faire a day I haue not seene   Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aughtThat man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,By each at once her choppie finger layingVpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,And yet your Beards forbid me to interpreteThat you are so   Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?  1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis   2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor   3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feareThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truthAre ye fantasticall, or that indeedWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble PartnerYou greet with present Grace, and great predictionOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feareYour fauors, nor your hate   1. Hayle   2. Hayle   3. Hayle   1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater   2. Not so happy, yet much happyer   3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:So all haile Macbeth, and Banquo   1.

Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liuesA prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whenceYou owe this strange Intelligence, or whyVpon this blasted Heath you stop our wayWith such Prophetique greeting?Speake, I charge you.Witches vanish.  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,Melted, as breath into the Winde.Would they had stay'd   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,That takes the Reason Prisoner?  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings   Banq. You shall be King   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?Enter Rosse and Angus.  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,The newes of thy successe: and when he readesThy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst makeStrange Images of death, as thick as TaleCan post with post, and euery one did beareThy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,And powr'd them downe before him   Ang. Wee are sent,To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,Onely to harrold thee into his sight,Not pay thee   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,For it is thine   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,Which he deserues to loose.Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,And vantage; or that with both he labour'dIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,Haue ouerthrowne him   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,Promis'd no lesse to them   Banq. That trusted home,Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray'sIn deepest consequence.Cousins, a word, I pray you   Macb. Two Truths are told,As happy Prologues to the swelling ActOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:This supernaturall sollicitingCannot be ill; cannot be good.If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,Against the vse of Nature? Present FearesAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,Shakes so my single state of Man,That Function is smother'd in surmise,And nothing is, but what is not   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,Why Chance may Crowne me,Without my stirre   Banq. New Honors come vpon himLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,But with the aid of vse   Macb. Come what come may,Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure   Macb. Giue me your fauour:My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,Where euery day I turne the Leafe,To reade them.Let vs toward the King: thinke vponWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speakeOur free Hearts each to other   Banq. Very gladly   Macb. Till then enough:Come friends.Exeunt.Scena Quarta.Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, andAttendants.  King. Is execution done on Cawdor?Or not those in Commission yet return'd?  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:Who did report, that very frankly heeConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,And set forth a deepe Repentance:Nothing in his Life became him,Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,As one that had beene studied in his death,To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,As 'twere a carelesse Trifle   King. There's no Art,To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.He was a Gentleman, on whom I builtAn absolute Trust.Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.O worthyest Cousin,The sinne of my Ingratitude euen nowWas heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,More is thy due, then more then all can pay   Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,In doing it, payes it selfe.Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,By doing euery thing safe toward your LoueAnd Honor   King. Welcome hither:I haue begun to plant thee, and will labourTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowneNo lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,And hold thee to my Heart   Banq. There if I grow,The Haruest is your owne   King. My plenteous Ioyes,Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themseluesIn drops of sorrow.

Bring them before vs.Exit Seruant.To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thusOur feares in Banquo sticke deepe,And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes thatWhich would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,To act in safetie. There is none but he,Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is saidMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,When first they put the Name of King vpon me,And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,Put Rancours in the Vessell of my PeaceOnely for them, and mine eternall IewellGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,And champion me to th' vtterance.Who's there?Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.Exit Seruant.Was it not yesterday we spoke together?  Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse   Macb. Well then,Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:Know, that it was he, in the times past,Which held you so vnder fortune,Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.This I made good to you, in our last conference,Past in probation with you:How you were borne in hand, how crost:The Instruments: who wrought with them:And all things else, that mightTo halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,Say, Thus did Banquo   1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs   Macb. I did so:And went further, which is nowOur point of second meeting.Doe you finde your patience so predominant,In your nature, that you can let this goe?Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,And for his Issue, whose heauie handHath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'dYours for euer?  1.Murth. We are men, my Liege   Macb.

I am one, my Liege,Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the WorldHath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,To spight the World   1.Murth. And I another,So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,That I would set my Life on any Chance,To mend it, or be rid on't   Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie   Murth. True, my Lord   Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,That euery minute of his being, thrustsAgainst my neer'st of Life: and though I couldWith bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,That I to your assistance doe make loue,Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,For sundry weightie Reasons   2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,Performe what you command vs   1.Murth. Though our Liues-  Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.Within this houre, at most,I will aduise you where to plant your selues,Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,That I require a clearenesse; and with him,To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:  Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fateOf that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,Ile come to you anon   Murth.

You must leaue this   Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:Thou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues   Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne   Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowneHis Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summonsThe shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note   Lady. What's to be done?  Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,And with thy bloodie and inuisible HandCancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,Which keepes me pale.

My deerest Cooz,I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowesThe fits o'th' Season.

Thou speak'st withall thy wit,And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?  Wife. I, that he was   Son. What is a Traitor?  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,And must be hang'd   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?  Wife. Euery one   Son. Who must hang them?  Wife. Why, the honest men   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for thereare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,and hang vp them   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:But how wilt thou do for a Father?  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if youwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickelyhaue a new Father   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?Enter a Messenger.  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.If you will take a homely mans aduice,Be not found heere: Hence with your little onesTo fright you thus.

Whether should I flye?I haue done no harme. But I remember nowI am in this earthly world: where to do harmeIs often laudable, to do good sometimeAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)Do I put vp that womanly defence,To say I haue done no harme?What are these faces?Enter Murtherers.  Mur. Where is your Husband?  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,Where such as thou may'st finde him   Mur. He's a Traitor   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine   Mur. What you Egge?Yong fry of Treachery?  Son.

What I beleeue, Ile waile;What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,He hath not touch'd you yet.

But Macbeth is.A good and vertuous Nature may recoyleIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.Though all things foule, would wear the brows of graceYet Grace must still looke so   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes   Malc. Perchance euen thereWhere I did finde my doubts.Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,Without leaue-taking. I pray you,Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,What euer I shall thinke   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,And the rich East to boot   Mal. Be not offended:I speake not as in absolute feare of you:I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gashIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,There would be hands vplifted in my right:And heere from gracious England haue I offerOf goodly thousands. But for all this,When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore CountryShall haue more vices then it had before,More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,By him that shall succeede   Macd. What should he be?  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I knowAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,That when they shall be open'd, blacke MacbethWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore StateEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'dWith my confinelesse harmes   Macd. Not in the LegionsOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'dIn euils, to top Macbeth   Mal. I grant him Bloody,Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinneThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, noneIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vpThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my DesireAll continent Impediments would ore-beareThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,Then such an one to reigne   Macd. Boundlesse intemperanceIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beeneTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,And fall of many Kings. But feare not yetTo take vpon you what is yours: you mayConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot beThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so manyAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,Finding it so inclinde   Mal. With this, there growesIn my most ill-composd Affection, suchA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,Desire his Iewels, and this others House,And my more-hauing, would be as a SawceTo make me hunger more, that I should forgeQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,Destroying them for wealth   Macd. This Auaricestickes deeper: growes with more pernicious rooteThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath binThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your willOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,With other Graces weigh'd   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,I haue no rellish of them, but aboundIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I shouldPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,Vprore the vniuersall peace, confoundAll vnity on earth   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:I am as I haue spoken   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?Since that the truest Issue of thy ThroneBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall FatherWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,Thy hope ends heere   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passionChilde of integrity, hath from my souleWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughtsTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,By many of these traines, hath sought to win meInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes meFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboueDeale betweene thee and me; For euen nowI put my selfe to thy Direction, andVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiureThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,For strangers to my Nature. I am yetVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.At no time broke my Faith, would not betrayThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delightNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speakingWas this vpon my selfe.

When I came hither to transport the TydingsWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a RumourOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.Now is the time of helpe: your eye in ScotlandWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,To doffe their dire distresses   Malc. Bee't their comfortWe are comming thither: Gracious England hathLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,An older, and a better Souldier, noneThat Christendome giues out   Rosse. Would I could answerThis comfort with the like. But I haue wordsThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,Where hearing should not latch them   Macd.

Thou was't borne of woman;But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.Enter.Alarums. Enter Macduffe.  Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armesAre hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edgeI sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,By this great clatter, one of greatest noteSeemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,And more I begge not.Exit. Alarums.Enter Malcolme and Seyward.  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,The day almost it selfe professes yours,And little is to do   Malc. We haue met with FoesThat strike beside vs   Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.Exeunt. AlarumEnter Macbeth.  Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dyeOn mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashesDo better vpon them.Enter Macduffe.  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'dWith blood of thine already   Macd. I haue no words,My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier VillaineThen tearmes can giue thee out.Fight: Alarum  Macb. Thou loosest labourAs easie may'st thou the intrenchant AyreWith thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeldTo one of woman borne   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'dTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers wombVntimely ript   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,That palter with vs in a double sence,That keepe the word of promise to our eare,And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters arePainted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,Heere may you see the Tyrant   Macb. I will not yeeldTo kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,Yet I will try the last. Before my body,I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.Exeunt. fighting. Alarums.Enter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.Retreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,Seyward,Rosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.  Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,So great a day as this is cheapely bought   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,He onely liu'd but till he was a man,The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'dIn the vnshrinking station where he fought,But like a man he dy'de   Sey. Then he is dead?  Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrowMust not be measur'd by his worth, for thenIt hath no end   Sey. Had he his hurts before?  Rosse. I, on the Front   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,I would not wish them to a fairer death:And so his Knell is knoll'd   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,and that Ile spend for him   Sey. He's worth no more,They say he parted well, and paid his score,And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.Behold where standsTh' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,That speake my salutation in their minds:Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.Haile King of Scotland   All. Haile King of Scotland.Flourish.  Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and KinsmenHenceforth be Earles, the first that euer ScotlandIn such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,Which would be planted newly with the time,As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,Producing forth the cruell MinistersOf this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,Tooke off her life. This, and what need full elseThat call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,We will performe in measure, time, and place:So thankes to all at once, and to each one,Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.Flourish.
